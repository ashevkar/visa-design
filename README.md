## 🔥 What I Built

This tool is more than a simple input/output box—it’s a complete experience tailored for developers who want to move fast with confidence.

### ✅ Core Features:

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, `@visa/nova-react`
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (mock API + JSON-based history store)
- **DevOps:** GitHub, GitHub Actions, deployed on **Render**
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1, VGAR, semantic HTML, tab flow, aria labels

## 🤖 AI & Me

I used **ChatGPT** for bug fixes and **GitHub Copilot** to create some boilerplate code. But all key logic—component mapping, user flow, accessibility hooks, and design—was written and decided by me.

## 💭 If I Had More Time...

- Make the integrated OpenAI component engine smarter
- Add live preview of generated components
- Create a VSCode extension version for inline usage
- Add authentication to save favorite prompts/snippets per user

---

## 💡 Motivation

This tool enhances developers working with Visa’s design system. It simplifies and supports UI creation, improves consistency, and saves time—especially during prototyping stage.

It’s something I’d genuinely use in my own daily workflow (should have the improvements mentioned above) and that’s what I aimed for.
