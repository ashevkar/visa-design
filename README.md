## 🔥 What I Built

This tool is more than a simple input/output box—it’s a complete experience tailored for developers who want to move fast with confidence.

### ✅ Core Features:
- 🧠 **Natural language to component mapping** using a custom-built rule engine
- 🌐 **Mock API with Node.js + Express** to fetch metadata for VPDS components
- 🧳 **Onboarding Tour** built using Nova Dialogs for first-time users
- ♿️ **Accessibility-first design** — I followed **WCAG** & **VGAR** guidelines to ensure clarity, focus visibility, contrast, and keyboard navigation
- 📋 **"Copy to Clipboard"** support for seamless snippet reuse
- 🕓 **Recent history tracking** stored in local JSON for fast reuse
- 🪄 Fully styled using **Nova Theming** with responsive layout and smooth UX

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, `@visa/nova-react`
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (mock API + JSON-based history store)
- **DevOps:** GitHub, GitHub Actions, deployed on **Vercel**
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1, VGAR, semantic HTML, tab flow, aria labels

## 🤖 AI & Me

I used **ChatGPT** for brainstorming architectural ideas and **GitHub Copilot** to reduce some boilerplate. But all key logic—component mapping, user flow, accessibility hooks, and design—was written and decided by me.

## 💭 If I Had More Time...

- Integrate OpenAI to make the component engine smarter
- Add live preview of generated components
- Create a VSCode extension version for inline usage
- Add authentication to save favorite prompts/snippets per user

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This tool removes friction for developers working with Visa’s design system. It simplifies UI creation, improves consistency, and saves time—especially during prototyping or handoff stages.

It’s something I’d genuinely use in my own daily workflow—and that’s what I aimed for.
